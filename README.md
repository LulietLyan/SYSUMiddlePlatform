## Introduction

This project is the front end of the assignment of software engineering practice. The main contributor of this repository is the creator of this repository, a.k.a 彭挚诚. We aim to create a data middle platform, intergrating functions such as data analysis, project management and administration of all projects. 

We use Vue3 as the framework of the front end. The folder management follows the standard Vue project rules. You can see the codes in src. 'api' folder contains the http request sending functions; 'views' folder contains the web view codes.
